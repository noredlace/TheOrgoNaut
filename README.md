# TheOrgoNaut66

A design by u/lizardsticks

A an ergonomic ortholinear 60% board. Inspiration from the atreus with a twist on the modifiers and keys to fit most keycap designs. <br /> 

Nonstandard keycaps include the 2.25u Novelty on the left side. This keycap is meant to be used with either the Enter Key or a Novelty Enter Key. 

The left shift key was chosen to be a 2.75u with the right shift being a split shift 1.75u + 1u key.

I suppose the inner column 1u keycaps for 5,3 nd 5,4 could potentially be difficult to find, in the meantime the numpad of a keycap set should suffice.

This allows the keyboard to be symmetrical while having good compatibility with most base keycap sets.

The color code helps identify the rows of diodes that will be used. The spacing allows for me to visualize the columns. The actual PCB won't have the spacing that you see on the left and right side. The triangle spacing in the middle will stay.

Before this, I had made the matrix based off the position of keys, which made tracing messy due to a multitude of crossed traces. Thus I made necessary changes to allow for cleaner traces and minimal vias.

You can also see the row and column numbers to visualize the schematic.


Schematic was done in a 9 x 8 layout. This is due to the 66 keys on the OrgoNaut. <br />

As you can see in the photos, the pcb is relatively clean in terms of the tracing. Of course its relative to how much of a mess my previous trace attempts have been.
