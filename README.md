# TheOrgoNaut66

A design by u/lizardsticks

A an ergonomic ortholinear angled board. Inspiration from the atreus with a twist on the modifiers and keys to fit most keycap designs. <br /> 

Nonstandard keycaps include the 2.25u Novelty on the left side. This keycap is meant to be used with either the Enter Key or a Novelty Enter Key. 

The left shift key was chosen to be a 2.75u with the right shift being a split shift 1.75u + 1u key.

Schematic was done in a 9 x 8 layout. This is due to the 66 keys on the OrgoNati. Limitations of the ProMicro's PinOuts means the tracing is messy due to the odd path of each switch/diode. <br />

The glory of ugly tracing can be seen
