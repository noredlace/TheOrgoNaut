# TheOrgoNaut66

A design by u/lizardsticks

A an ergonomic ortholinear angled board. Inspiration from the atreus with a twist on the modifiers and keys to fit most keycap designs. <br /> 

Nonstandard keycaps include the 2.25u Novelty on the left side. This keycap is meant to be used with either the Enter Key or a Novelty Enter Key. 

The left shift key was chosen to be a 2.75u with the right shift being a split shift 1.75u + 1u key.

The color code helps identify the rows of diodes that will be used. Before this, I had made the matrix based off the position of keys, which made tracing messy due to a multitude of crossed traces. Thus I made necessary changes to allow for cleaner traces and minimal vias.



Schematic was done in a 9 x 8 layout. This is due to the 66 keys on the OrgoNaut. <br />
